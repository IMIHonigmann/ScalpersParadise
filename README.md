## _What??_ ‰Ωï

ScalpersParadise is a sophisticated movie booking system designed to maximize user retention with positive reinforcement and gamification. People are being motivated to interact with other users with price benefits and awards

## _Why??_ ‰Ωï„Åß

One thing that has always bothered me is the disconnect among moviegoers. The "best" seat is often considered the one farthest from others, which feels counterintuitive ‚Äî watching movies should be a shared experience. That‚Äôs why I created this project: a conceptual movie theater designed to bring people together and celebrate the communal aspect of cinema.
